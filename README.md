# Capital_bike_sharing_EDA
This is a repository containing EDA of Capital bike sharing compony, located in Washington DC.
 Here worked on there different datasets: hour.cvs and day.cvs which contain hourly and daily observations + weather conditions (available on: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) and datasets from 2017-2022 which include information about the location of stations, bike types ,... rxcluding the weather conditions (available on https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/index.html). I investigated effect of weather (temperature, humidity and windspeed) on the usage of bikes. I also looked at the location of the most used stations and those with longest bike trips.
Here, the effect of Corona on the bike sharing compony has been investigated. The Corona resulted in a huge drop in the usage of bikes in 2020 (lock down period) and as data shows the componey has not recovered from the effect of Corona yet (till end of 2022).
